# Collaboration Workflow Report

## Branching
- Created three feature branches:
  1. `feature/html-structure`
  2. `feature/css-styles`
  3. `feature/js-functionality`

## Commits
- Committed every major change with descriptive messages
- Squashed multiple minor commits before merging to main

## Pull Requests
- Created PRs for each feature branch to `main`
- Added review comments and made necessary fixes


## Conflict Resolution
- Resolved conflicts in `index.html` during rebase of `feature/html-structure`
- Used `git add` and `git rebase --continue` to finalize

## Merge Strategy
- Used merge commits to keep branch history clear
- Ensured `main` always had the final approved code
