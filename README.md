# RPG Creature Search App
## Project Overview
**Welcome to the RPG Creature Search App! This is a simple, single-page web application that allows users to search for creatures by their name or ID from a simulated RPG universe. It fetches data from an external API to display information such as creature stats, weight, height, and special abilities in a clean, user-friendly interface.**

This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in core web development technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Search Functionality: Users can search for a creature using a name or an ID number.

- Dynamic Data Display: The app fetches and displays creature information including name, ID, weight, height, types, and base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.).

- Responsive Design: The app's layout is designed to be easily viewable on various screen sizes.

- Interactive UI: The search button and input field are configured to provide a smooth user experience.

- External API Integration: It uses the https://rpg-creature-api.freecodecamp.rocks/ API to retrieve creature data.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the core structure and content of the web page.

- CSS: Styles the app, including custom fonts and a distinct color palette, to create an engaging visual experience.

- JavaScript: Handles all the interactive functionality, including fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the page content based on user input.
